				<h1>The Journey of building This</h1>

				<section><h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>The initial idea for a personal website came to me last summer. A lot of people told me that "100 skill x 0 visibility = 0." At this time, I hated LinkedIn and hated being part of this fake community; I felt like no one was real there. It was a sick place to be.</p>
<p>I started to look at how people build their websites. I had just finished learning about game programming and wanted to use those skills with something like WASM or WebGL. Then, I found the amazing <a href="http://dustinbrett.com">dustinbrett</a> and <a href="http://fahru.me">fahru</a>. Seeing their work, which involved a lot of personal detail, I got more excited and started to look into how I could build my own site like theirs.</p>
<p><img alt="doomsc" src="/images/doomsc.png" /></p>
<h2>Initial Start</h2>
<p>I was not interested in learning anything about web development then; I just wanted to learn the minimum to get my site working. I started with Vuepress when I saw how easily <a href="http://me2resh.com">me2resh.com</a> was made and followed some tutorials for a while before getting bored. There was nothing exciting, just a few templates, and it was hard to add a personal touch and a story. I went to The Odin Project and got what I needed to go my own way. The summer ended, and I got back to university and forgot about it until a friend sent me <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this</a> and <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/">this</a>. Later, I read the suckless website. I found beauty in the simplicity and understood what they were trying to say.</p>
<p><img alt="suckless" src="images/suckless.png" /></p>
<p>Then, I didn't know exactly what I wanted to build. <a href="https://benadam.me/">Ben's</a> website was my goal at the time.</p>
<h2>Building Software is Art</h2>
<p>One day, while Browse Hacker News, I found <a href="https://goodinternetmagazine.com/my-website-is-ugly-because-i-made-it/">this</a> blog. I went to <a href="http://taylor.town">taylor.town</a> and just fell in love. I loved how he expressed himself in his own way; it was like a painting to me that I stared at for hours over several weeks. A few days later, I stumbled upon <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="TMMM" src="images/TMMM1.png" />
<img alt="TMMM" src="images/TMMM2.png" /></p>
<h2>How This Was Built</h2>
<p>I didn't know where to start. While scrolling Twitter, I found a comic about a dreamy night with a frog, which I stared at before going to an LLM for more inspiration.</p>
<p><img alt="inspi" src="images/inspi.png" /></p>
<p>It gave me a place to start. I finished putting my own touch on it and editing what I felt needed to be changed. I searched for a good CMS and found <a href="https://izolate.net/posts/build-your-own-static-site-generator">this blog</a> and <a href="https://blog.hamaluik.ca/posts/build-your-own-static-site-generator/">this post</a>, which led me to <a href="https://github.com/munificent/game-programming-patterns/blob/master/script/format.py">this script</a>.</p>
<p>It was a great journey that led me to learn more about myself. Thanks to everyone who tries to build things with passion.</p></section>
